# Text-to-Speech-Python
Very simple python program to convert text to speech! Offers the ability to also save it as an mp3 to a specific path!

## How to use:

Run in terminal:
`python text-to-speech.py`

Choose your options, and done!

If you want, you can make a input.txt file and it will read from there, or you can just input thetext in console.

## Config:

You can change the speaking rate and the volume in the text-to-speech.py file (below the import, you will see 2 lines of code underneath the config comment)
